# Why
The project is currently undefined (empty directory). We need to establish the project identity, technology stack, and development conventions to enable consistent future development.

# What Changes
- Create `README.md` with project description and tech stack details.
- Update `openspec/config.yaml` with project context and conventions.
- Initialize `go.mod` for the backend.
- Initialize `package.json` for the frontend.

# Capabilities

## New Capabilities
- **Project Structure**: A defined workspace with backend (Go), frontend (TypeScript), and database (SQLite3) ready for development.

# Impact
- `README.md`: New file.
- `openspec/config.yaml`: Updated with tech stack and conventions.
- Root directory: Initialized with language config files.
