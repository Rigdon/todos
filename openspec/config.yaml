  Project: Todos (Task Management)
  Stack: Go (Backend), TypeScript (Frontend), SQLite3 (Database)
  Conventions:
    - A PR MUST be opened for every task as soon as the spec is ready for implementation
    - MUST NOT ever commit to main branch
    - Short, meaningful commit messages
    - Full test coverage
    - PRs MUST be less than 400 lines
    - Use common libraries for logging
    - When a task is completed, it MUST be committed on the worktree
    - When a task is completed, a PR MUST be created and merged before prompting me to archive the task
